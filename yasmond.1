.SH NAME
YASMon \- Yet another system monitor - server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B yasmond [-p PORT]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fByasmond\fR hosts a simple server, providing to any client
information about the status of the computer on which the server is
being hosted. This information ordinarily includes: CPU load, memory
usage, disk usage, and a high-level overview of the activity of
various server processes.

Since anyone can connect to the server without authentication, it is
important to be sure that the information YASMon provides is not
sensitive. If the information is sensitive but YASMon must still be
used, it may be wise to hide YASMon with a firewall.
