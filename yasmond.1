.TH YASMOND "1" "April 2010" "YASMon 0.1.0" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
YASMond \- Yet another system monitor - server daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B yasmond [-p PORT]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fByasmond\fR hosts a simple server, providing to any client
information about the status of the computer on which the server is
being hosted. This information ordinarily includes: CPU load, memory
usage, disk usage, and a high-level overview of the activity of
various server processes.

Since anyone can connect to the server without authentication, it is
important to be sure that the information YASMon provides is not
sensitive. If the information is sensitive but YASMon must still be
used, it may be wise to hide YASMon with a firewall.

The update intervals of certain \fByasmond\fR parts are limited for
practical reasons (smaller update intervals result in less accurate
statistics). In these instances, \fByasmond\fR performs the update at
the maximum frequency regardless of input from \fByasmon\fR instances.
